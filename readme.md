# Project 1: Minesweeper

---
### Overview
---
This project is my first fully developed exercise at General Assembly's Software Immersive course.

The assignment was to create a grid-based game that could utilise array-based logic, moving parts and variable difficulty settings to be rendered in the browser, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project deadline was to be completed individually, within one week.

I chose to create  Minesweeper because it was my favorite computer game growing up, and it was one of the highest-difficulty games we were presented. The interface is quite simple, so I won't discuss CSS or HTML very in-depth, but the JavaScript logic is fairly complex, so in this document I'll guide you through it.

Are you curious to see the end result? [Check out the demo.](https://psopher.github.io/Minesweeper/)
